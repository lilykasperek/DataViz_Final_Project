I decided I wanted to do a blogdown project, and looked at different blogdown websites for inspiration. I looked at many different data sets using Kaggle. 

## March 23 Beginning of Class

I created a new project for my blogdown website, found and imported different data sets to use for different posts, created some new posts, linked my GitHub, and minimally messed around with some of the data sets I found. I am not sure how to link the new project/website to GitHub and am not sure how to push the work I did.
