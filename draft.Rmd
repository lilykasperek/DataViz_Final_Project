## Written Description 
The general purpose of this project is to curate many different data visualizations using a variety of data sets. I want to create a personal website using blogdown to share these data visualizations. I decided to use data that was interesting to me, and found that I was most interested in data examining the political donations made by professional sport team owners from different leagues. 

Data Ethics: 
* Political donations are public information; scraped the data from Kaggle, did not realize until today (April 10th) that fivethirtyeright actually published a piece using this data but luckily the visualizations that I have already made are different from those on fivethirtyeight 
* did not exclude N/A for a party affiliation point because I did not think there was any reason other than making the legend look better 

Expressing Variability:
* Use scatter plots to show variability in data, and use bar plots to show the count of categorical variables 

Motivation and Grammar of Graphics:
* Used theme() for the style of my visualizations 

## Political Donations of Professional Sports Team Owners

## Questions: What were the highest 25 Political Donations made by NFL team owners in 2016? Were the majority of these donations affiliated with a certain party? How much influence could NFL team owners have on elections? Is there any gender that dominates?
```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, echo = FALSE}

## Questions: Which owners, across all leagues, have made the most political donations from this data set? How many have they made? Is there a certain gender that dominates? 
```{r}

owner_rank2 <- pol_donations %>% group_by(Owner, Team, League) %>%
  summarise(n = n()) %>%

      col.names = c("Owner", "Team", "League", "Donations Made")) %>%
  kable_styling(html_font = "Cambria", bootstrap_options = "striped",
                font_size = 9) 
```

## Questions: How much money was spent for these donations? Do these donations tend to be made to the same party for each owner or do they vary? What is the total sum of the donations made by these individuals? What is the average amount per donation? 
```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
